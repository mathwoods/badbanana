# Bad Banana
A text-based game that challenges players to add, subtract, multiply or divide integers 
as many times as possible.

Please use Python 3.8+ to run this game on your command line as I use the walrus operator
at least several times for this project. 

The easiest way to try Bad Banana out is to clone the repo and run the following command from the 
project's root folder.

```
>> python3 play.py
```

Enjoy!
